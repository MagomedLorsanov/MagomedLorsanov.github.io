			<p> My name is Muhammed. I am studing Computer engineering. It's my third year in university. You have to learn to balance your academic work and social life. At first, I spent too much time going out and hardly any time in the library. You learn from your mistakes and you soon learn how to balance it all.

I have a grant, a student loan, money from my parents and various holiday jobs to keep me going. I worked out that I have pounds 45 per week for living (after rent). I feel that the financial situation for students is rapidly getting worse. As grants are decreasing more and more students are relying on student loans and getting overdrawn. You must be so careful with your money, because one day you have it, the next you don't.

University has been the best time of my life. It's three years of hard work and great fun. It's a positive thing to do! I was quite involved in our Student Association right from the word go. I wanted to do something that was still outside my course so I could meet new people. I got involved in the welfare side of things. It's a student's chance to say, "I don't like the way this is being done, let's change it!" I'm never one to sit around and complain about things. If something's bad, I want to change it and that's what the Student Association does. I'm now what you call a sabbatical, which means there's an election held in which all students can vote. There were three of us elected as President and two Vice-Presidents. My area of responsibility is welfare, which means that if there's any problem that affects a lot of students at Heriot Watt, it is my duty to inform students how they can spend their money better. I arrange financial fairs, talks with British Gas, the Electricity Board and British Telecom. It's also my duty to tell the university what's going on, what's affecting the students and to try to campaign through the National Union of Students to the Government.</p>
